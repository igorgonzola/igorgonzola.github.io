        <h2>Model of Good Practice in UI Design</h2>
        <p>
          When designing the UI for this site, simplicity and consistency
          were my main concerns. A simple, single-colour palette was chosen
          to avoid sensory overload, and the colours used were kept light
          in order to avoid text blending in with the background colours.
          Interactive elements (such as buttons) were animated to avoid
          confusion, as well as to make sure the user knows they can interact
          with the element. Navigation elements within the user interface
          were also kept consistent on each page to avoid having the user
          learn how to use the website again each time they navigate to
          a different part of the website.

        <h2>Inspiration and Planning</h2>
        <p>
          One of my main inspirations for the design of this website was
          this portfolio site from Dribbble (<a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3272390-HBK-Creative-Agency">link</a>):<br />
          <img src="images/inspiration.png" alt="Website screenshot" /><br />
          I chose a similar layout to the site shown above, with a horizontal
          navigation bar across the top of the site and content below. A similar
          colour scheme was also chosen, however lighter/more muted colours
          were used, similar to popular social networking sites like Twitter
          and Facebook. The website was also split into pages instead of featuring
          one continuous page for the website. This user interface layout is
          quite common and therefore increases accessibility. This is because
          new users will be able to use what they have learned from using
          other websites and easily navigate this site.
