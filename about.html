        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          My name is Igor Zajac and I was born in Poland on July 30th, 1998.
          After having spent most of my early childhood in Zielona Gora,
          I moved to Wisbech in 2007 where I continued my education, finishing
          with 13 C-A* GCSEs and a DMM Computing BTEC. After this, I moved to
          Northampton to do a BSc in Software Engineering.

        <h2>History in Computing</h2>
        <p>
          My interest in programming began with Macromedia Flash. I realised
          I was more interested in programming than art after finding out
          that I had more fun messing around with ActionScript than actually
          animating. From this point on, I started experimenting more with
          basic HTML, CSS and Python, later moving on to small projects
          in Unity using C#. After finishing my BSc, I plan on finding
          a career in software engineering.
